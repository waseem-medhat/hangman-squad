# Hangman Squad

REST API backend for a multiplayer Hangman game.

## Getting Started

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed and set up a
database instance on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/).

- Clone this repo.
- `cd` into the project root directory.
- Install the dependencies using NPM (or your preferred package manager).

```bash
npm install
```

- Make a copy of the example `.env` file and set the variables in the new file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

- Use any of the scripts in `package.json` as you need. `npm run dev` will run
a development server and auto-reload when the code changes.
